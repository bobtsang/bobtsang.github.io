## Data Management 

`Master Data Management` focues on maintaining `Single Source of Truth (SRT)`

> Unless people, processes and technology are in place to ensure that the data values are **kept aligned across all copies**, it is almost inevitable that different versions of information about a business entity will be held... At a basic level, master data management seeks to ensure that an organization does not use multiple (potentially inconsistent) versions of the same master data in different parts of its operations, which can occur in large organizations.
