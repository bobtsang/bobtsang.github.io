## Shell

Shell is a programming environment. It parses the command by splitting it by whitespace, and then runs the program indicated by the first word, supplying each subsequent word as argument

- `~` short for home
- `$` tells you that you're not the root user 
- functions: `echo`,`date`, `cat`,  helper function `man`
- `\` as escaping character of space
- `/` is called absoute path
- `.` refers to he current, and `..` to its parent directory
- `>` append to file
- `|` chain program together such that the output of one is the input of another
