This space is created because I feel like notes are all around my google keep notes, evernotes, google docs and so on. It's becoming hard to keep track of all these.

I find that if I don't have time to review all summaise a topic I encounter, my time will be wasted. And it's just like a loop. We see problems, we research it, we solve it, and forget about it.

I want to also share with others about these pieces. Hope that it would be helpful for the technical community.
