## Styles of API

- Entitry-oriented

> my code manipulates the entities you expose

It's usually more structured. 

- Procedure-oriented

> my code calls your procedure / function/ method

The list can get really long and hence can be messy.

## Principle of design

The foundamental problem in most integration projects is creating relationships between entities stored in different applications.
