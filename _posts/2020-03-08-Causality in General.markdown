When A and B are dependent, there are three possibilities of their relationship

1. A causes B
2. B causes A
3. Something else causes A and B


What is [causal graph](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Causal_graph)?

> a causal diagram is a Bayesian network in whic every arrow signifies a direct causal relation, or at least the possibility of one, in the direction of that arrow. --- Judea
