## Why do we write documentation?

- If people don't know why your project exists, they won't use it.
- If people can't figure out how to use your code, they won't use it.

## What to write

- What problem your project solves
- A small code example
- A link to your code & issue tracker
- FAQ: needs to keep it up to date
- How to get support?
- Information for people who want to contribute back

## Words

- Use same unambiguous word or term consistently throughout document
- When to use `acronyms`

  - Don't define acronyms that would only be used a few times.
  - Do define acronyms that meet both of the following criteria:
    - The acronym is significantly shorter than the full term.
    - The acronym appears many times in the document.

- Avoid using `Pronoun`

## Active Voice

> Active Voice Sentence = actor + verb + target

- Most readers mentally convert passive voice to active voice
- Passive voice obfuscates your ideas, turning sentences on their head
- Some passive voice sentences omit an actor altogether
- Active voice is generally shorter than passive voice


## Guideline for different types of documentation

### Handover documentation

A handover documentation is needed for reducing the risk of an employee leaving the company with knowledge and experience.

For long-term hand-over, there shouild always be both a face-to-face conversation and a written document.

List of items should be included into this document

- dailys tasks and processes
- access to all documents
- project deadlines and status updates
- key contacts
- ongoing issues and risks for project
- details of all logins and passwords
