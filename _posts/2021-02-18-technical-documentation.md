## Words

- Use same unambiguous word or term consistently throughout document
- When to use `acronyms`

  - Don't define acronyms that would only be used a few times.
  - Do define acronyms that meet both of the following criteria:
    - The acronym is significantly shorter than the full term.
    - The acronym appears many times in the document.

- Avoid using `Pronoun`

## Active Voice

> Active Voice Sentence = actor + verb + target

- Most readers mentally convert passive voice to active voice
- Passive voice obfuscates your ideas, turning sentences on their head
- Some passive voice sentences omit an actor altogether
- Active voice is generally shorter than passive voice
