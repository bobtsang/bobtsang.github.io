## Virtual Environments

It may not be possible that Python installation to meet the requirements of every application or library.

> The solution for this problem is to create a virtual environment, a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages.

### Creating virtual environment

The following will create a directory named `sample-env`.
```
python3 -m venv sample-env
source ./bin/activate
-- activating the virtual env
```

### Overview of packages and solutions

From 2., I have a high-level summary of tools that used in the domain of dev environment setup in Python.

- `virtualenv`: For virtual env management. combined with `virtualenvwrapper` or `pyenv-virtualenv`
- `pyenv`: control choice of Python version to be used for any application
- `pipenv`: makes installing Python libraries and virtual environment easy; But seems the project is declared dead by some people.
