#### Database system overview

Database system would mainly compos 4 parts

1. transport layer accepting requests
2. query processor optimising the queries
3. an execution engine
4. storage engine

#### Comparing Database

- Schema and record sizes
- Number of clients
- Types of queries and access pattern
- Rates of the read and write queries
- Expected changes in any of these variables

#### Database Management System (DBMS)

> A database system usually separates data files and index files: data files store data records, while index files store record metadata and use it to locate records in data files.


#### Naming Convention

##### Tables

1. Singular Names
Table names should be singular because

- Indicating one record per row, level of details; It's like `class` in programming language
- do not need to worry about plural transformation in English: person --> people

2. Prefixes

- Should avoid if not necessary; typing more characteres if having it
- Helpful when you need to group related tables together

#### Terminology

##### ACID

- Atomicity
  An operation either succeeds completely or fails, it does not leave partial data.
- Consistency
  Once an application performs an operation the results of that operation are visible to it in every subsequent operation
- Isolation
  An incomplete operation by one user does not cause unexpected side effects for other users
- Durability
  Once an operation is complete it will be preserved even in the face of machine or system failure
