## Introduction

> An experiment is a test or a series of tests.

### History

> Agricultural applications dominated designed experiments for, probably most of the 20s and 30s. It wasn't until World War II that we began to see an expansion of designed experiments into industrial work. And this was largely because of experimental work that went on during the war for developing weapons systems and medical treatments for injuries.

### Principles of Design of Experimentations

- Randomization
    - Running the trials in an experiment in random order
- Replication
    - Sample size

- Blocking

### Factorial Design

> In a factorial experiment, all possible combinations of factor levels are tested

- Fractional Factorial Design
### Goals of experiments

- Reduce time to desgin and develop new products and process
- Improve performance of existing processes


> At the core of the Lean Methodology is the scientific method: Creating hypotheses, running experiments, gathering data, extracting insight and validation or modification of the hypothesis.

Necessary Ingrediants for running user controlled experiments

1. There are experimental units that can be assigned to different variants with no interference.
2. There are enough experimental units.
3. Key metrics, ideally an [OEC](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/understanding-experimentation-platforms/9781492038139/ch03.html), are agreed upon and can be practically evaluated.
4. Changes are easy to make.

## The Hypothesis Testing Framework

- Sampling from a normal distribution
- Statistical hypothesis

### Estimation of Parameters

- For example: mean, variance

### Terminologies

- critical value (statistics)
- `reference distribution`
- P-value approach
- Pooled t-test, Two-Sample t-Test
    - t<sub>0</sub> serves as signal-to-noise ratio
    - Checking assumptions: normal probability plotting
