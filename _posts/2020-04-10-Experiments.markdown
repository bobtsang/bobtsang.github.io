> At the core of the Lean Methodology is the scientific method: Creating hypotheses, running experiments, gathering data, extracting insight and validation or modification of the hypothesis.

Necessary Ingrediants for running user controlled experiments

1. There are experimental units that can be assigned to different variants with no interference.
2. There are enough experimental units.
3. Key metrics, ideally an OEC, are agreed upon and can be practically evaluated.
4. Changes are easy to make.
