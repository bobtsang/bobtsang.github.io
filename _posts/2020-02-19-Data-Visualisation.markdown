### Overview

I think data visualisation is the most underestimiated skills in data education. Engineers and analysts would not pay too much attenntion to it because of various reasons.

```
Anyone can turn data into some graphs. It's remarkable and ..scary.

```

### Why visualisation

Visualizations enables people to explore, analyze and understand information that is hidden in the data.

### Why not visualisation

Business needs are so dynamic. Certain types visualisations are not scalable. As a principle, we need to keep visualisation as simple as possible. That will limit the complexity and hence limit 'information volume'.

But as you may know, less is more. More information does not translate to more insights or faster decision-making.

### How to do data visualisation

```A Silly theory means a silly graph.

#### What to avoid


- Don't do pie chart.
- Don't do donut chart.
- Don't use 3D.
- Avoid using dual axis, unless with proper mapping of color or shape.

### Visualisation theory giants

Main comparison
Stephen Few (laymen) vs. Edward Tufte (more sophisticated)

1. William S. Cleveland, Design and interpretation of visual information artifacts
2. Colin Ware: human perception and memory model associated with visualisation
3. John W. Tukey: statisitcs
4. Gene Zelazny: practical guidelines on charts and slideware
5. Jonathan G.Koomey: high-level process from data to knowledge
6. Edward Tufte: <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10775.Edward_R__Tufte>
