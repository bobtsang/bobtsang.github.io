## What is Language

> Language is a structured system of communication that involves complex combinations of its constituent components, such as characters, words, sentences etc.

- `Phonemes`: smallest units of sound
- `Morphemes and Lexemes`: `Morphemes` is the smallest unit of language that has a meaning. `Lexemes` are the structural variations of `morphemes` related to one another by meaning.
- `Syntax`
- `Context`

## Regex

### Basics

Each character in a regular expression (that is, each character in the string describing its pattern) is either 

- a metacharacter, having a special meaning
- a regular character that has a literal meaning


1. Boolean `|`
2. Grouping `()`

```sql
gray|grey
gr(a|e)y
```

3. Quantification

Quntifier after a token (character or group) to specify how often that a preceding element is allowed to occur
