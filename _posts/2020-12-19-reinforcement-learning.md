## What is Reinforcement Learning?

> .. is the training of machine learning models to make sequence of decisions.. to maximize the reawards under complex uncertain environment

## Elements of Reinforcement Learning

- Policy
It defines the learning agent's way of behaving at a given time. It can be a lookup table or function.

- Reward Signal
On each time step, the environment sends the agent a single number of reward.

- Value Function
It specifies what is good in the long run.

- The Model of Environment
