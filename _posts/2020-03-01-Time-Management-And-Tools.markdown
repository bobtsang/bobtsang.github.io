## Overview

To me, time is the most important resource for individual human being. You trade your time with something else. And you're largely determined by how you spend your time.(resonating with "You're what you eat!")

But are we just too naive to think that everything can be broken down into similar size of tasks?

## Methodologies

- GIST: Goals, Ideas, Step-Projects, and Tasks
    GIST is focusing more on reducing management overhead.

  - Goal: something that is relatively stable and coherent with your long-term plan. It needs to be

        - measurable
        - difficult
  
  - Idea: potential ways to reach the goal
        > until they're being actively developed, ideas reside in an "Idea Bank"
        - scoring models
          - RICE: Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort
  
  - Step-Projects
    - experiments to production
    > capped timespan 10 weeks; each step-project gets evaluated multiple times
  - Tasks
