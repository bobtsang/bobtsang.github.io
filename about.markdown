The purpose of this space

1. for myself to write learning notes down
2. share with other people

Tools: Notion, Baidu Naotu

Previously I used Evernote, but I found that it's more like a library to me (too much information with less structure). 

With Notion, I spend more time on reading, learning and mapping items into structure.
Naotu helps visualise tree structure of knowledge. Others also also suggest using Mira and Draw.io to draw knowledge map.

But the ultimate concept I'm interested is causal map. Hope I will have the opportunity to explore that.
